# Recreating Sugarscape
In an effort to better understand the research done by Joshua Epstein and Robert Axtell I am recreating their famous work from "Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up" - Sugarscape. I first learned about their work while reading "The Origin of Wealth" by Eric C. Beinhocker:

> In 1995, they decided to conduct an experiment to see if they could grow an economy from scratch. Like biologists trying to cultivate life in vitro in a petri dish, Epstein and Axtell wanted to see if they could spark economic life _in silico_, in the simulated world of a computer.

## What is Sugarscape?
The landscape or environment for the experiment is a 50x50 grid of cells containing one commodity - sugar. Agents were given rules to see if anything resenbmling the real world emerged from the system. 

By adding simple rule based agent modeling Epstein and Axtell were able to observe 

I will be using their published book as the guide for recreating Sugarscape and hopefully creating interesting opportunities to interactively explore more questions along the way.
